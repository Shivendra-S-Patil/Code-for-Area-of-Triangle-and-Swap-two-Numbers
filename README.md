# Code-for-Area-of-Triangle-and-Swap-two-Numbers
This Python script calculates the area of a triangle based on user-provided input for the triangle's height and base. Also demonstrate how to swap the values of two variables (x and y) using a temporary variable (temp) and without using a third variable. 

Calculate Area of Triangle
This Python script calculates the area of a triangle based on user-provided input for the triangle's height and base. It uses the formula (0.5) * base * height to compute the area and then displays the calculated area to the user.

Swap Two Numbers
With Using a Third Variable
This Python script demonstrates how to swap the values of two variables (x and y) using a temporary variable (temp). It first assigns the value of x to temp, then assigns the value of y to x, and finally assigns the value of temp back to y, effectively swapping the initial values of x and y.

Without Using a Third Variable
This Python script efficiently swaps the values of two variables (x and y) without using a third variable. It uses tuple unpacking (x, y = y, x) to swap the values in a single line of code, exchanging the initial values of x and y.
